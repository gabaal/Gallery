# Gallery

tabs works through thumbnails and previous / next buttons.
when in focus previous and next buttons work with the spacebar.
screen reader is not quite right, it reads the thumbnail alt text and the annouceAltText function doesn't seem to do anything.
Left and right arrow keys on keyboard call the prevImage nextImage functions but do not work while in screen reader mode.

ToDo:

images load quickly - lazy loading?
add search using unsplash?
